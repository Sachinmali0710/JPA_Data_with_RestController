# JPA_Data_with_RestController
This project demonstrates the implementation of Java Persistence API (JPA) for seamless database interaction combined with RESTful APIs to enable CRUD operations. The goal is to create a robust backend application that connects to a relational database and exposes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
